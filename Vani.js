It is a verb, demonstrated in consistent acts of support, patience during disagreements, and sacrifices made without expecting recognition. It's a commitment to nurture another's well-being and growth, especially when it is difficult.",

It is a silent language understood only by the heart, a force that dismantles the walls of the self to build a bridge to another soul. It's the profound and beautiful recognition of your own humanity in the eyes of another.",

It is a steady presence that says, 'You are safe with me, exactly as you are'.",

It is the conscious decision to see the best in them even when they are at their worst, and to commit to their journey as if it were your own. It's less about finding a perfect person and more about learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.",
